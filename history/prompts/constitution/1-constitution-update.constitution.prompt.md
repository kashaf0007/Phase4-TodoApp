# Constitution Update

## User Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Updated the project constitution from Phase II (Todo Application) to Phase III (Todo AI Chatbot Project). The new constitution emphasizes:

- Agentic authority with AI-driven decision making
- Tool-only side effects through MCP tools
- Stateless architecture requirements
- Persistent memory through database records
- AI behavioral guidelines and conversation flow laws

The constitution now properly reflects the requirements for the Phase III Todo AI Chatbot Project with appropriate architectural principles and governance structures.

## Outcome

Successfully migrated the constitution from version 1.0.0 to 2.0.0, replacing the Phase II Todo Application principles with Phase III AI Chatbot principles while maintaining proper governance structure and amendment procedures.
